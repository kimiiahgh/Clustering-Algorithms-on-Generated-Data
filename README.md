# Clustering-Algorithms-on-Generated-Data
In this repository we have:
1)Generated the data set indicated in image.png.
2)Used 5 clustering methods, Kmeans, Fuzzy Cmeans (added) , DBSCAN, CURE, and CHAMELEON to cluster the data for different parameter setting like different k values for Kmeans, CURE etc (at least 3 cases for each) and visualize the outputs.
